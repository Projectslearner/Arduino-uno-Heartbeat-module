# Arduino-uno-Heartbeat-module.
The Arduino Uno Heartbeat Module measures heartbeats by detecting changes in blood volume. It typically uses photoplethysmography (PPG) to monitor heart rate, enabling applications in health monitoring, fitness tracking, and biofeedback systems for real-time heart rate measurement.
